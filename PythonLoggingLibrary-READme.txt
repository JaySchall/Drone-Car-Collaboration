# The logger library in ROS provides different logging levels for messages.
# These levels help categorize and prioritize log messages based on their importance.

# DEBUG: Detailed information, typically used for debugging purposes.
# INFO: General information messages about the operation of the system.
# WARN: Warning messages indicating potential issues that are not critical.
# ERROR: Error messages indicating a problem that has occurred but does not prevent the system from continuing.
# FATAL: Critical error messages indicating a severe problem that may lead to the termination of the system.

# These logging levels allow you to control the verbosity and granularity of log messages in a ROS application.
