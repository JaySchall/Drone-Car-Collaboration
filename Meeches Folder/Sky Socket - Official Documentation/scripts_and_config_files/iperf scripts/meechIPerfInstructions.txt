Get set up:
- On the drone, install iPerf using the command "sudo apt install iperf3"
- On a linux machine connected to the same netowrk, run the same command. 
(if you dont have a linux machine or a way to make a vm connect to the 
network, there is a windows gui version, though Im not familiar with it at 
all so send me a message if this is the case)
- Run "ifconfig" or "ip addr" on the linux machine to find it's ip

Running the TCP test:
- On the linux machine, run the command "iperf3 -s -p 5201 -V --logfile 
iperfTest.txt" 
(I 
think that should be what I want. If it doesnt work, try removing options 
1 at a time from last to first. the bare minimum command should be "iperf3 
-s")
- Connect to the drone via ssh (hopefully this is set up, lmk if not)
- Get the drone flying in the air
- While the drone is flying, run the command "iperf3 -c <computers IP> -t 
30"
A connection should be made between the drone and computer for 30 seconds 
while they test a TCP connection.
- Rerun this test 3 times (you dont have to restart the linux server every 
time, you can connect with the drone 3 times in a row)
To end the server program, use control c

Running the UDP test:
- On the linux machine, run the command "iperf3 -s -u -p 5201 -V --logfile   
iperfUDPTest.txt"
(I
think that should be what I want. If it doesnt work, try removing options
1 at a time from last to first. the bare minimum command should be "iperf3
-s")
- Connect to the drone via ssh (hopefully this is set up, lmk if not)
- Get the drone flying in the air
- While the drone is flying, run the command "iperf3 -c <computers IP> -u 
-t 30"
- Rerun this test 3 times

Let me know if some of this doesnt work or if you have any questions!
